// Setting up a Java development environment
// To start developing with Java you must first install a Java Development Kit (JDK). You can find the latest by searching JDK online
// With a JDK you can run .java programs in terminal by navigating to their directory then running javac HelloWorld.java to compile the program, then java HelloWorld.java to execute the program

// IntelliJ is the IDE of choice for programming in Java
// You can install a free community version of IntelliJ at: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html


// All Java code must be inside a class
// The name of your class must match your file name
public class Main {
    // The main() function is the entry point to your program
    // Start typing "main" and IntelliJ will autocomplete the main function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello from the IntelliJ IDE");
    }
}
